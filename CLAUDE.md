# CLAUDE.md - Flutter Project Guide

This is a comprehensive Flutter project with multi-flavor support, Firebase integration, and extensive tooling.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Structure

### Key Directories
- `lib/` - Main Dart source code
  - `common/` - Shared utilities, helpers, and constants
  - `data_source/` - API services, database, Firebase, and preferences
  - `model/` - Data models with Freezed, JSON serialization
  - `ui/` - Pages, components, and view models
  - `navigation/` - Auto route navigation setup
  - `exception/` - Error handling and exception mapping
- `test/` - Unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests
- `assets/` - Images, fonts, and other resources
- `dart_defines/` - Environment-specific configuration files
- `tools/` - Custom Dart tools for project maintenance

### Key Files
- `makefile` - Build automation and common commands
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and project configuration
- `analysis_options.yaml` - Dart analysis rules
- `l10n.yaml` - Localization configuration

## üîß Essential Commands

### Quick Setup
```bash
make gen_env        # Generate environment configurations
make sync           # Full project sync (pub get, l10n, build_runner)
make ref            # Clean and refresh everything
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
make pg             # Flutter pub get (includes super_lint)
make ln             # Generate localizations
make fb             # Build runner (generate code)
make ccfb           # Clean then build runner
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make lint           # Run all linting (super_lint + analyze)
make te             # Run all tests (unit + widget)
make fm             # Format code and sort ARB files
make check_ci             # Full CI pipeline locally
```

### Testing
```bash
make ut             # Unit tests only
make wt             # Widget tests only
make ug             # Update golden test files
```

### Building Apps
```bash
# APK builds
make build_dev_apk  # Development APK
make build_qa_apk   # QA APK
make build_stg_apk  # Staging APK
make build_prod_apk # Production APK

# iOS builds
make build_dev_ipa  # Development IPA
make build_qa_ipa   # QA IPA
make build_stg_ipa  # Staging IPA
make build_prod_ipa # Production IPA
```

## üì¶ Flavors & Environments

### Supported Flavors
- **develop** - Development environment
- **qa** - Quality assurance environment  
- **staging** - Pre-production environment
- **production** - Live production environment

### Configuration Files
- `dart_defines/develop.json` - Dev environment variables
- `dart_defines/qa.json` - QA environment variables
- `dart_defines/staging.json` - Staging environment variables
- `dart_defines/production.json` - Production environment variables

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Golden Tests
- Located in `test/ui_kit/`
- Update with `make ug`
- Used for visual regression testing

### Unit Tests
- Located in `test/unit_test/`
- Focus on business logic and utilities
- Run with `make ut`

### Widget Tests  
- Located in `test/widget_test/`
- Test UI components and interactions
- Run with `make wt`

### Integration Tests
- Located in `integration_test/`
- End-to-end testing scenarios

## üì± Key Dependencies

### State Management
- `hooks_riverpod` - Reactive state management
- `flutter_hooks` - React-like hooks for Flutter

### Networking & Data
- `dio` - HTTP client
- `firebase_*` - Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Analytics, etc.)
- `isar` - Local database
- `freezed` - Immutable data classes

### UI & Navigation
- `auto_route` - Type-safe navigation
- `cached_network_image` - Image caching

### Code Generation
- `build_runner` - Code generation runner
- `json_serializable` - JSON serialization
- `injectable` - Dependency injection

## üîç Code Style & Analysis

### Linting
- Uses `super_lint` (custom lint rules)
- Line length: 100 characters
- Dart formatter with strict rules

### Important Conventions
- Use Freezed for data models
- Follow Repository pattern for data sources
- Use Riverpod for state management
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

### Supported Platforms
- Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`)
- Bitbucket Pipelines (`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`)
- CodeMagic (`codemagic.yaml`)
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)

### Fastlane Integration
- iOS: `ios/fastlane/Fastfile`
- Android: `android/fastlane/Fastfile`
- Automated version bumping and deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Making Changes
1. Always run `make sync` after pulling changes
2. Use `make ci` before committing
3. Run `make te` to ensure tests pass
4. Update golden tests with `make ug` if UI changes

### Firebase Setup Required
- Configure `google-services.json` for each Android flavor
- Configure `GoogleService-Info.plist` for each iOS flavor
- Update Firebase project IDs in configuration files

### Multi-flavor Development
- Use `--flavor {flavor_name}` when running/building
- Each flavor has separate Firebase projects
- Environment variables defined in `dart_defines/` JSON files

### Performance Considerations
- Images are cached via `cached_network_image`
- Implement proper state management with Riverpod

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Run `make ref` (clean + refresh)
2. **Missing translations**: Run `make ln` 
3. **Generated code issues**: Run `make ccfb`
4. **iOS pod issues**: Run `make pod`
5. **Test failures**: Check golden files with `make ug`

### Clean Reset
```bash
make ref   # Full refresh (clean + sync)
```
